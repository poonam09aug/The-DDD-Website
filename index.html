                <p><label><b>History</b></label>
<p>
Dharmanism was formed by the BBB, founded by [REDACTED]. Dharmanism is the main religion of the BBB.

 	These first steps were very peaceful, with everyone cooperating. Things escalated, however as the creation of the Yes/No eraser changed everything. 

This relic brought instability as leaders were changed regularly. But, luckily [REDACTED] regained control of the BBB. The DDD (Dhar‚Äôs Democratic Dominion) soon realized that they were led by a dictatorship. The DDD declared independence from the BBB, starting the EdWars. After years of dedicated research, it was discovered that [REDACTED], was not, in fact, BBB. BBB is a separate god, inhabiting life forms in order to take control. The DDD resistance was shocked but kept on going. As of now, the DDD has located the BBB Church and Base, located in Antarctica, in an ice hill. Nothing else has yet been documented.
</p>
														

							<label><b>EdWars</b></label>
<br>
<p>
The EdWars has started when the Yes/No Eraser changed it all. The followers of the BBB were lied to and realized that the BBB was a dictatorship. That is when the BBB followers converted to be a part of the DDD, Dhar Mann‚Äôs Democratic Dominion. That is when they declared the EdWars! The Wars started recently, and the DDD is currently looking for soldiers. 
</p>





<p>
<label><b>Dhar Mann</b></label> 
<br>

Dhar Mann was born in a very poor family. He was always the ‚ÄòMann‚Äô of the family. Mr. Mann‚Äôs family could never even afford toenail clippers. He also fought depression; he was depressed because Rihanna hasn't released a new album. So sadü•∫. 

When he turned 69 years old he was drafted into the Bieberball war. He fought with Nickacardius Minajio in the Bieberball war against Justinus O‚ÄôBeaverballs. He fought bravely and won. He was then approached by a big buff dude with a huge giant Uranus-sized moustache. He said,‚Äúoui oui baguette‚Äù in his silky black and white shirt. 

Dhar Mann was then rewarded by becoming the Ruler of All Gods. All hail Dhar Mann; who bravely fought Justinus O‚ÄôBeaverballs.
</p>



<p>
																<label><b>Erectus</b></label>
<br>
Erectus is an early human, dating back tens of thousands of years ago. Long ago, he was a mortal, like anyone else, except for BBB. BBB was still ruling at that point of time; he is a god, after all.

 	All the other early humans worshipping him, but Erectus always knew something was off. Usually, early humans worked together, however, the BBB seemed to be commanding everyone else to do his bidding. This prompted Erectus to change his path. After years of training to fight back, he founded many of our modern inventions, such as the First Pengun, and the Yes/No Eraser, bound to be found by the former BBB members. 

He was ultimately killed afterwards. However, the gods of death have noted Erectus‚Äô deeds, and promoted him to god.
</p>







<p>
  <label><b>Big Brain [REDACTED]</b></label>
<br>



The gods of BBB decided to inhabit [REDACTED] for his peculiar intelligence and the fact his name started with a B. From then on out, [REDACTED] was given the title ‚ÄúBig Brain [REDACTED].‚Äù

However, it was soon discovered that [REDACTED]is not in fact god, the evil BBB god inspirited him so that he himself can rule.

Dhar Mann has given us a task to free the people of the BBB. We shall free the people from the bad acts of the BBB. We are asking all of you big or small, old or young, to help us finish the BBB. 

For information about conscription into the DDD check out our communications server where we discuss our plans to stop BBB. The DDD also holds assemblies where we all can participate. Our organization makes everyone equal. So what are you waiting for? Let‚Äôs take down the BBB!
